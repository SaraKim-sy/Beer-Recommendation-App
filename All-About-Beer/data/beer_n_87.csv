Birra veramente pessima, che non ha alcuna qualità. Riso bollito al naso, lo stesso alla bocca e poco altro se non la frizzantezza e la secchezza finale. Birra da lasciar perdere.

This is some nasty crap.  Watery with nothing flavorwise except for the slight rancid pilsner taste.  Give me a Miller High Life over this anyday.

I could make a ""Tastes Great! Less Filling!"" joke if I were wittier.  But I'm not, so I won't.
