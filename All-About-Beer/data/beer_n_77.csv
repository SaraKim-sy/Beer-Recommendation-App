Yikes, this is awful.  Basically tastes like a beverage that’s 60% mediocre lager and 40% water.  If you want to save money with very little drawback in return, drink just the water.

Tastes like a cheap light beer but no carbs.  Less carbs means no man boobs!  Drink this if you are worried about getting fat but me...I'd rather be fat.
