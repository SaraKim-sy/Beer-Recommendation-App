After letting getting through mor e than half of mine the flavor became a bit more pleasant. It has a sharpness in the bittering that is a little metallic.

Kind of an odd taste of the spectrum.  I really didn''t know where this beer was taking me.  I found the their Lager a much better example of their work.
