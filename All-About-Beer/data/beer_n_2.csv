This is by far the best beer Molson makes, although that doesn't say too much.  The beer is red, think, creamy , and goes down rather smooth.  A solid choice if your at the pub.

Nice red colour.  (well, duh!)  The head looks OK but dies.  There is a little bit of malt in the nose and the tiniest bit of malt in the flavour.  Other flavours are pretty much genericâ€¦

A favorite, especially when sitting at a patio pub watching people go by. Slow drinking/slipipng beer. More sophisticated than most Canadian brews. Definitely not to be chuggedâ€¦

Out of a bottle?  No way! On Tap and ice cold?  One of the best!  If there is Rickards on tap, be sure I'll have a pitcher or two.

Barely passable.  This is a beer best drunk from a pitcher on a hot summer day.  Empty Canadian taste with a pretty colour.

If you're going to go for a ""crafted"" brew, you might as well get a real one (i.e. not this one).

In my opinion, it tastes like Export with red food colouring. But if its not, still good. If it is, its still good because I like Export!

Rich dark amber colour.  No head.  Aroma of caramel and grains. Initial taste is of nothing.  This is followed by a mismatch of water and brewerâ€™s caramel.  Cloying and wateâ€¦
