Pours a hazy amber from the tap. Nose of banana-y yeast, but not as heavy as most hefeweizens in that. All in all a good balanced hefeweizen. Good beer.

Hazy blond beer. Nose of oranges, banana and wheat. Oranges and banana in the taste as well. Also some spices and bubblegum. I think this the best Hefe I have drunk so far.

Draft. Really tasty old German-style hefe. A touch of bananas, but mostly just lovely yeast and refreshing citrus. Just what a German hefe should be.

I did not care for this beer.  I guess I am not a big fan of Hefeweizens.  I will eventually get used to them, but I don’t really like the strong after taste with them.

This is very typical for the style...cloudy yellow, clove, banana peel from nose to finish.  I like my hefes to be a little more crisp than this....full bodied for a wheat.

Smelled of bananas and vanilla and tasted of bananas, clove and vanilla. Nice cloudy yellow color. Tasty wheat beer but i think i like a few others better.

Look at that presentation: Big rocky head. Smokey coriander, a bit of banana, and errr well a bit like the American breakfast cereal Wheaties. And that's a good thing.
