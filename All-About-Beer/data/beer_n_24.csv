Che dire... É una Heineken!  Bevibile se accompagnata con un bel panino... Schiuma non eccessiva, ben carbonata ma odore e sapore un pó piatti anche se non c’é niente che stoni.

Ugh. Not a good beer. I think this tastes more likes a yeasty carbonated beer with some hoppiness that gives it its ’bitterness.’

A good lager. It isn’t for nothing that it is the worlds most sold bottled beer. There is nothing remarkable to find. But there are neither any flaws that are obvious. It’s a beer.

Okay beer but way overpriced l.  Too much hops for a pale lager.  I would prefer it if it were a little more sparing with all the hops but then I’m afraid all i would have left is water.

33cl bottle. One of the most famous beer here, very light and drinkable, little sweet malty taste, good for refreshing in hot summer’s evenings and nothing more.

Pour a light yellow with a fizzy head.  Smells like a foot sprayed by a skunk.  Tastes like grassy water,  but smoother.  Goes down easy but that is about it.  Waste of money.

Holland’s second beer. Isn’t special at all, watery beer. Very popular in public. It’s just a brand with a good campaign and a big reputation.

Over-rated because it was one of the first widely available imports and was better than Miller and Bud.  Better on tap than in bottles as bottles do often attain a skunkiness.

Not a very good beer. It was just way to skunky. Any flavor or aroma was dominated by the skunky taste. I will never order this one again.

Gotta like the green bottle even if the beer sucks. Always has a skunky aroma and that's the truth. Not a good lager at all and I don't understand why people drink so much of it.
