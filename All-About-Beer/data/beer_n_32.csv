clear yellow with a white fizzy head.  Has a bit of a malty smell with a slight fruity flavor.  This is not a bad beer, but for the price i probably wouldnt put this into my regular rotation.

Skunky, of course. Light on malt but has pretty decent hop presence. Dry, bitter finish. Crisp. This is a simple, mass produced German pilsener, and is kind of boring.
