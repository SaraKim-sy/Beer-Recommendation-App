Rerate.  Still a good beer, but not as malty or hoppy as it was in the past.  Just seems to be a little more watery than it used to be.  Not as good as it was a year or two ago, unfortunately.

A beautiful full gold colour. Aroma hints at quality hops. Beer is a little too syrupy to be a true Pilsener though. It seems to me this used to be drier and slightly more characterful.
