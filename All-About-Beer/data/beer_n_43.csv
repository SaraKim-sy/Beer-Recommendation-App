Not a bad beer.  I prefer this to a lot of other Canadian beers. One complain however is that the appearance is less than appealing. It is almost clear.

This is neither crap, nor good, beer.  Unlike the other green bottles they serve at clubs, though, there is a slight bitter finish to let you know you got something for your 5$.
