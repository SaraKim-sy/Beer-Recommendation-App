Pretty solid as these sorts of lager go. Slightly sweet but not sickly, bitter without tasting like chemicals and not a watery mess in the mouth. Very drinkable.

This is exactly what a pilsner should taste like.  Ultra light and clean with citrus, floral, almost soapy hop flavor.  Are these Saaz hops?

Clear yellow, medium head. Crisp hops and malts in the nose. Malty sweetness (with notes of caramel) transforms into a pleasantly strong hoppy finish. Very nice and refreshing.

This beer sucks in bottles IMHO. On tap however, I was blown away by the clean, floral, delicate flavor. I'm not a pils guy but I consider it a treat to drink this PU under the right conditions.

Better drank in a can or from tap than in a bottle. The bottle is green and is most of the time skunked. In a can, you can smell fresh hops as you open it and poor in in a glass.

One of my favorites.  Great aroma, nice full flavor.  I would disagree with other reviewers that it is hoppy, it could stand a stronger hop finish to balance.

The best thing about this beer is that it's been around for almost 800 years.  Other than that, it's nothing very special.  Nice color, not too watery, but the taste is pretty ordinary.

Most of the time, this beer is skunked. But once in awhile, you can get a good one. The best pilsner(lager) I've ever had. Lots of woody, smokey flavor balanced with a mild hop finish.
