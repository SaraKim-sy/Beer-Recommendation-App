It had a average fizzy head.  The lacing was good.  The color was amber.  It had a light taste with not much flavor.  This would be a great beer with food.  Not to filling.

Very disappointing beer from a supposedly world renound brewer. Terrible aftertaste and not very smooth or satisfying. If you're going to spend this much, get a Bass.

Pretty good beer.  The hoppy smell is almost like Heineken, but the taste is far less bitter.

By far, my favorite lager (and not just because it's brewed by Guinness).  Full bodied, refreshing, The way a real lager should be!!  A bit pricey, but worth it!!  DRINK A LOT OF IT!!

Crisp clean nose. A very non demanding brew without alot of assertiveness. Slight bitterness add's to it's enjoyment. That said, it could still use a little more bite especially at the end.
