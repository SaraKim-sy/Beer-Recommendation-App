For a beer lover, this misses the boat;the taste and texture is too distant and bland.  It does not fit in with the other beers that make Sleeman great.

You might as well drink tap-water. At least it's free and there are ZERO carbs in water. This beer looks fine (for a light beer), and smells ok, but doesn't taste like much.  Whatâ€¦

Like everyone said-  watery.  Little or no head, little or no carbonation-  tasted and looked like a beer left for a few days.  Not worth the low-cal trade off.  Skip this one.

I'll agree with cartoon khaki here.  it tastes like someone spilled a little corn syrup in their club soda.  absolute crap.  if you're so worried about carbs don't drink beer.
