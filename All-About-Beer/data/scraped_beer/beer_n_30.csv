Chang is second to Singha in Thai beer. Not very much to write home about, very little taste with perhaps a bit more body than singha. Gives a nasty hangover, for some reason.

Similar in most ways to the other doubrie, a largely forgetable asian lager. Pale in colour and flavour with a thin body.

Poured clear orange gold with a fast disappearing head. An aroma that is all wet dog and vegetal. A flavour that is all sugary sweet malt. Another crappy lager. (Bottle - 5% abv)

Little in the way of aroma, and likewise, little in the way of flavour! Initially the pale gold body was topped by a fairly thick white head, but that fizzled away in seconds to leave…

5%.  Dark golden body with a good size lasting white head. Light metallic hop aroma. Sweetness at first then a harsh aftertaste. If I am in Thailand give me a Singha!
