Light gold with almost no aroma.  A thick head.  IPA?? This ale looks, feels and tastes like a pilsner.  Very light in body, no appreciable ale flavors.  Are they sure this isn’t a lager?

Pale yellow color with a weak head.  Aroma is alright but not overpowering.  Hops really overwhelm the taste. Sits nicely on the palate.  Decent.

Utterly vile stuff. Has no right to claim to be an IPA--no hops flavor. More like a megabrew lager.

A great full flavoured ale, well brewed and well loved by Maritimers.  Those accustomed to smoother lighter beers may find it a little to hearty, but ""Those who like it, like it alot""!
