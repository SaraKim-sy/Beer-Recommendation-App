If you need to get drunk cheap, this is the way to go. Greenish smell matches the bottle. The alcohol bite makes it tolerable.No head at all. A college favorite.

Nothing all too bad, but definitely forgettable. Sweet taste and finish; fairly smooth and refreshing going down. Overall another bland beer.

I remember years back, after a long day of hunting, pulling a big-mouth out of an icy cooler, and how good it tasted. I just could never seem to re-live that experience.

No trailer park jokes, please.  Mickey's isn't that bad.  The problem is, it isn't that good either.  The wide mouth bottles rule!
