Thin, useless and you really get to look far to find a character. Works probably best as a thirst quencher, but the Mexican beers are much better at that as well.

You can change the label, you can change the bottle, you can stack it differently in the beer store, it is still totally unremarkable. Better off drinking bottled water.

If you’re looking for cheap beer, this is probably my favorite.  It doesn’t have a lot of flavor, but that’s not always a bad thing.  Best on a hot day served ice cold.

Horrible. The cheapness of Budweiser with the delightful taste of carbonated sewage. Drink a lot of it so you don''t have to deal with the aftertaste.

Just when you thought the beer was no longer 'in' the beer with regular Bud... But hey, it's cheaper than bottled water.

Not a bad beer for being a light.  Its taste isn’t that bad, and it does get the job done.  I personally like this better  than Budweiser.

The one and only thing Bud Light has going for it is consistency. Unless someone butchers it it's going to be the same tasteless brew anywhere ya go.

I never buy Bud Light for myself, but my wife likes it.  When drinking this type of beer, I usually go with Miller Lite.  There really is not that much difference, though.  Sometimes it…

I had trouble discerning between this and miller lite.  Little flavor, little aroma, little of anything.  I guess great to chug, but watch out for a nasty hangover.

Slightly preferable to Bud, actually - and that’s because this watered down version has less of the funky green apple and bitterness of Bud.  Ugly watery urine color.  Very fizzy.
