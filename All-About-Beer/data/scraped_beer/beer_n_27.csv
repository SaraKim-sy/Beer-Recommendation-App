16 oz can from my local Walmart.  Pours a hazy golden color with white head that lasts and leaves good lacing.  Aroma is not terribly strong, but has pineapple, wheat, and melon.â€¦

Spicy old-school west coast IPA aroma. Basic pale golden body with an off white head. Tastes malty, not much hops. Very thick palate, doesn't really match the style. Average.

16 ounce can from Cork & Cellar. Very 1980s looking can design. Not a bad thing. Amber, tinge of haze, large frothy tan head, good retention. Aroma of pale wheat, piney hops.â€¦
