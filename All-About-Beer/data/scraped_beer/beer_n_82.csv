Boring beer.  I was looking for some nice hops, especially since they advertise Fuggles and Golding on the label, but this tasted bland.

I used to like this a lot more than I do now.  Is this supposed to be some kind of hybrid or something, all I taste is the cream ale.  Relatively shallow body and dry finish.
