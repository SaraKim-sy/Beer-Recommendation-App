I thought it would be a good beer.  Upon tasting it, though, it was truly harsh on the initial and aftertaste.  For a lager it has a good colour and appearance but that’s about it.

Bottle. Pours a crystal clear yellow, with a foamy white head. Smells like rotting compost, tastes like club soda. This sucks a whole lot of ass.

Pours clear yellow, like vitamin-depleted urine, and smells pretty close to the same.  Some sour notes, like a used urinal cake.  I’d comment on the taste, but there isn’t one.
