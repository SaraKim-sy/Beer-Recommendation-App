Gold colored with a white head on it. Very smooth and delicious. By far my favorite import. It comes ganished with a lime, but toss it aside and let the full flavor hit you.

Tap in NY, USA. Very pale, hay yellow. Almost no nose at all and flavor is very very faint with some funkiness I can’t really point finger at. No hops, no real maltiness. Pretty horrible.

Nothing to say about the aroma.  A little tinny in the palate. Appearance ding for the green bottle.  Screams for a lime. Overall, inoffensive, but I prefer Bohemia.

A really good beer, but it fails to live up to the standards set by dos equis amber. Still this is a quality brew and i wouldn't mind having one of these right now.

Much better than the standard Dos Equis.  Most bartenders/waiters do not know ""Lager Speciale"" so ask for the Dos Equis in the green bottle for best service.

This is not a great beer by any means, but it IS a great beer on a really hot day. It has a light maltiness and a very dry finish. Buy it only from a liquor store which sells a lot of it.…

Not very good from the start as soon as i opened the bottle, I inhaled a whiff of skunkiness. The beer did not taste very skunky, to my surprise, but had an almost fake taste to it,…

I think this is a reasonably good lager.  It's light, crisp, and clean. I have a soft spot for Mexican beer when it's accompanied with good Mexican food.  And maybe that's…

what an amazingly unremarkable ""beer!""  I thought to myself, the only reason this isn't Bud is because it is an import.  It is markedly better than bud though, as there is no lingering…
