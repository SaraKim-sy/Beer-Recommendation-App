Not so great lager from a great brewer.  Decent enough, drinkable, but I would not go out of my way for it.  The Pure Brewed lager is better.

Very similar to their Lager Beer. The aroma was citrusy, but the taste did not seem to deliver. It seemed a little watery, and too sweet. I definetely would drink this over the standardâ€¦

Fruity and good, though a bit light for my taste. Cool idea though, certainly better than anything wolavers has to offer. Id stil go with the Sams natural brewed lager though.
