A famosa cerveja dos Estados Unidos. Ela é suave e com uma drinkabilidade razoável. Mas tem um retrogosto desagradável. Nada demais, não vale o preço.

Seemingly watered down beer but distinct flavours. A little sweet, strong almost spicy flavour in the aftertaste. A good definitive ’American Beer’ indeed.

Point one better than bud light. Fizzy grain water. And poor grain flavor at best. Way too carbonated, gives me acid reflux. A lime doesn’t even cover up wet grain nonsense.

I didn’t like this beer at all. My overall opinion is that instead of purchasing this you can carbonate water by yourself and you would pretty much get the same result.

The self proclaimed ""king of beers"" is better called the pile of steaming crap of beers. Its bitter, stale tasting that only gets easer to drink after you down four of five quick ones.

Long lasting, horrible aftertaste.  Highly carbonated.  Someone should try and sell thei piss as Bud products.  It tastes the same and they could make a lot of money off of it.

Horrible beer. Head that disapears as fast as you pour it, and absolutely very thin body, no distinctive taste. Flavored water.

it one of the best beers --- if you plan on drinking 12+.  Tastes like water and let’s face it if your drinking to get drunk,  the beer has no flavor after the sixth anyway.

This is a strange beer.  It smells and tastes (I assume) like urine.  However, it starts to grow on you.  It’s easily drinkable and affordable.  However, it’s not that great of a beer.

Pale coloring with negligible head. Prominent yeast flavor with strong corn notes. Watery feel. Refreshing beer. Cheap and easy to drink. Bottled is superior to canned.

Better than Miller, or Coors. I fill my cooler with this when I go fishin, or other occasions where lots of canned beer is appropriate.

I'm re-rating this, sober this time.  Its still not my favorite, but it does loosely resemble a pilsner, only more watery than its supposed to be.  I have to say I like this a lot better than…

A void! Nothing is going on here! This probably tastes like my urine after 8 pints of Guinness.

Remarkably pale yellow, even for a macrobrew.  Aroma of fusels and light acetaldehyde, plus some rotting vegetables.  Ethereal body.  Flavour, such as it is being completely overru…

In lieu of a few points Shamrck71 made, I'm re-rating this beer. Maybe I didn't use the correct phraseology on my last rating. I apologize if I've offended any Bud fans out there by…
